    "### Basic Terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "**TypeDesc**: as data type description, describes a base data format type, aggregation into simple vector and matrix types, and an array length (if it’s an array).\n",
    "\n",
    "**string_view**: is a non-owning, non-copying, non-allocating reference to a sequence of characters. It encapsulates both a character pointer and a length. For all of these cases, no extra allocations are performed, and no extra copies of the string contents are performed (as they would be, for example, if the function took a const std::string& argument but was passed a char* or string literal).\n",
    "\n",
    "**ustring**: Efficient unique strings. A ustring is an alternative to char* or std::string for storing strings, in which the character sequence is unique (allowing many speed advantages for assignment, equality testing, and inequality testing).\n",
    "  - cons:\n",
    "    - Each individual ustring is very small.\n",
    "    - Storage is frugal.\n",
    "    - Assignment from one ustring to another is just copy of the pointer.\n",
    "    - Equality testing (do the strings contain the same characters) is a single operation, the comparison of the pointer.\n",
    "    - Memory allocation only occurs when a new ustring is constructed from raw characters the FIRST time subsequent constructions of the same string just finds it in the canonical string set, but doesn’t need to allocate new storage.\n",
    "  - Suitable scenarios:\n",
    "    - if you tend to have (relatively) few unique strings, but many copies of those strings.\n",
    "    - if the creation of strings from raw characters is relatively rare compared to copying or comparing to existing strings;\n",
    "    - if you tend to make the same strings over and over again, and if it’s relatively rare that a single unique character sequence is used only once in the entire lifetime of the program;\n",
    "    - if your most common string operations are assignment and equality testing and you want them to be as fast as possible;\n",
    "    - if you are doing relatively little character-by-character assembly of strings, string concatenation, or other “string manipulation” (other than equality testing).\n",
    "    \n",
    "**span/cspan**: Non-owning array views, just like it in cpp17. cspan for span\\<const T\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROI**: Rectangular region of interest. It is a small helper struct describing a rectangular region of interest in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ImageSpec**: An ImageSpec is a structure that describes the complete format specification of a single image. It contains:\n",
    "  - The image resolution (number of pixels) and origin.\n",
    "  - The full size and offset of an abstract “full” or “display” window.\n",
    "  - Whether the image is organized into tiles, and if so, the tile size.\n",
    "  - The native data format of the pixel values (e.g., float, 8-bit integer, etc.).\n",
    "  - The number of color channels in the image (e.g., 3 for RGB images), names of the channels, and whether any particular channels represent alpha and depth.\n",
    "  - A user-extensible (and format-extensible) list of any other arbitrarily-named and -typed data that may help describe the image or its disk representation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**DeepData**: “Deep” pixel data. A DeepData holds the contents of an image of ``deep’’ pixels (multiple depth samples per pixel).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic example**: Write out an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#include <OpenImageIO/imageio.h>\n",
    "using namespace OIIO;\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "const char *filename = \"foo.jpg\";\n",
    "const int xres = 640, yres = 480;\n",
    "const int channels = 3;  // RGB\n",
    "unsigned char pixels[xres*yres*channels];\n",
    "\n",
    "std::unique_ptr<ImageOutput> out = ImageOutput::create (filename);\n",
    "if (! out)\n",
    "    return;\n",
    "ImageSpec spec (xres, yres, channels, TypeDesc::UINT8);\n",
    "out->open (filename, spec);\n",
    "out->write_image (TypeDesc::UINT8, pixels);\n",
    "out->close ();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Different way to write out**\n",
    "  - Writing individual scanlines \n",
    "  \n",
    "  `out->write_scanline (y, z, TypeDesc::UINT8, scanline);`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Writing individual tiles \n",
    "  \n",
    "  `if (! out->supports (\"tiles\")) // Test if the format support tiles`\n",
    "  `out->write_tile (x, y, z, TypeDesc::UINT8, tile);`\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Writing individual rectangles\n",
    "  \n",
    "  `if (! out->supports (\"rectangles\"))  // Test if the format support rectangles`\n",
    "  `out->write_rectangle (xbegin, xend, ybegin, yend, zbegin, zend, TypeDesc::UINT8, rect);`\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Convert pixel data type**\n",
    "  - resetting the pixel data type must be done before passing the spec to open(), or it will have no effect on the file.\n",
    "  - The default is to use the entire positive range of each integer type to represent the floating-point (0.0 - 1.0) range.\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### **Strides**\n",
    "Stride parameters for write functions are like offset to each direction, **in bytes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please consult Section ImageOutput Class Reference for detailed descriptions of the stride parameters to each “write” function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Crop or overscan window**"
